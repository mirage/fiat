synopsis: "Primitives for Elliptic Curve Cryptography taken from Fiat"
description: """
This is an implementation of the ECDH over P-256 key exchange algorithm, using
code from Fiat (<https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto>).

Cryptographic primitives should not be used in end applications, they are better
used as part of a cryptographic library.
