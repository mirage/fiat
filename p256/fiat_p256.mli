    The format is the uncompressed format described in
    {{http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf}SEC1}, section 2.3.4, that is to say:

    - the point at infinity is the single byte "00".
    - for a point (x, y) not at infinity, the format is:
      - the byte "04"
      - x serialized in big endian format, padded to 32 bytes.
      - y serialized in big endian format, padded to 32 bytes.

val scalar_of_cs : Cstruct.t -> (scalar, scalar_error) result
(** Read data from a cstruct.
    It should be 32 bytes long, in big endian format. Returns an error when the
    number is zero, or if it is larger than or equal to the group order. *)

val scalar_of_hex : Hex.t -> (scalar, scalar_error) result
(** Like [scalar_of_cs] but read from hex data. *)

val dh : scalar:scalar -> point:point -> Cstruct.t
(** Perform Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This returns the x component of the
    scalar multiplication of [point] and [scalar]. *)

val public : scalar -> point
(** Compute the public key corresponding to a given private key. Internally,
    this multiplies the generator by the scalar.
    Given the invariant on [scalar], the result can't be the point at infinity. *)
